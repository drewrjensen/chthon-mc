# Enable the GeyserExtras menu, which can be opened by players by
# double-tapping inventory, or typing `/ge`.
#  
# The GeyserExtras Menu provides actions and configurable settings such as
# - Remapping certain actions (e.g emotes/pick block) to Java Edition only actions (e.g offhand)
# - Configurable HUD Visibility
# - Quick access to form remakes of Java Edition Menus
#   (e.g Player List, Advancements, Statistics).
#  
# You can configure default options for Bedrock Players at
# `preferences/default.json`
# and for Java Players at
# `preferences/java/default.json`.
#  
# Setting this to `false` also disables saving of preferences.

# Enable the Block Display entity workaround using FMBE. (EXPERIMENTAL)
# Note that the translation is not 100% accurate and some block types might be invisible (candles, doors, campfires),
# where as some blocks will render differently (fence, glass panes, some storage containers).
# Block Display billboards do not work and X/Z scale are linked to which ever one is highest,
# meaning that this should only be enabled for very simple usages of Block Displays.
